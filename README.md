Repo contains only backup of history of old alpha builds. Final build is not present here (file size contraints). In case of interest you can contact me and I will will provide one. 

This project made in 2017 started with a motivation to explore posiblities of 3D art production pipeline. Theme of this place is underground railway, kids without home and pillow forts. In game footage.

## Pipeline
Soft objects: Marvelous Designer -> Instant Meshes -> Blender -> Substance Painter -> Unity 2017 (pillows, sheets, curtains)
Hard surface objects: Unity 2017 -> ProBuilder -> Substance Painter -> SplineMesh (walls, conduits, card boxes)
Softbody-physics simulations : Unity 2017 -> Caronte FX (paper/wind, falling pillow)
